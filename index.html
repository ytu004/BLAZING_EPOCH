            <p>My work revolves around traditional cultural elements, which I aim to blend with modern media to create a unique, interdisciplinary artistic style. I am committed to exploring the intersection of tradition and innovation through multimedia storytelling, challenging traditional modes of representation and creating stunning visual effects. I believe that in the digital age, it is especially important to preserve and promote traditional culture, as it serves as our foundation and a source of inspiration and strength. In my own work, I attempt to use traditional cultural elements to showcase their beauty and value in new ways.</p>
            <p>At the same time, my interdisciplinary projects primarily focus on multimedia storytelling. I employ different media such as painting, photography, video, and audio to fully express my ideas and emotions. My work often encompasses various themes, such as identity, historical memory, and social issues. Through interdisciplinary creation, I strive to break down barriers between disciplines, merging different ideas and perspectives to create entirely new art forms.</p>
            
            <p>
             Overall, my work not only embodies traditional cultural elements, but also blends them with modern media to explore new artistic languages and forms. Through interdisciplinary creation, I hope to break away from traditional artistic expression and create more personalized and diverse works to provide audiences with deeper and more meaningful experiences.
