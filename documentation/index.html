                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>In traditional RPGs, the player enjoys fixed content designed in advance by the designer. In a sense, it's not so much that the player is choosing the game as it is that the game is choosing the player. Players don't buy into a game for a genre they don't like. So, when you play the game, you have in fact been chosen by the game.
                    </p>
                <p>The intention of the game is to create a game that the player can actually "choose". Through the "reverse tech tree" design, player behavior is recorded and counted in the background of the system, and the game mechanism itself is changed according to the tendency of the player's behavior.

                    </p>

                    <p>Based on an open world RPG game, players will act according to their own preferences, so the more times an action is performed, the more it represents the player's own preferences. For example, if the player prefers to ignore enemy attacks and forcefully fight against them, then the player's character will quickly adapt to the player's style and have higher toughness and value to provide the player with the basis for fast combat. If the player is the type of careful to cope with the battle, will be in the battle with the enemy constantly pulling, repeatedly through the rolling dodge control distance, in such a case, the game will appear more auxiliary UI and features such as attack dodge hints used to change the game's overall fighting style.

                        </p>

                        <p>In addition, if the player likes to collect, and collects all kinds of props and trophies on the map, he will unlock the collection direction function like picture books, photo albums and related achievements.
                            If the player likes to run a business, always running around the map and choosing the cheapest store to buy goods, they can unlock the "floating price system", and make a profit by reselling.
                            If the player likes to gather his own food, gather fruits from the roadside, and get meat by destroying beastly enemies, then the player will unlock the farming and cultivation system.
                            At this point one might ask, "Why not add all the features right from the start?"
                            
                            
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>First of all, a content-rich game is a good game yes, but extreme richness is in fact a monotony.
                            Overly complex functions and systems can make people fumble and be overwhelmed, and having too much to do can greatly slow down the progress of doing things and drain the player's enthusiasm.
                            Therefore, from the perspective of game design, the authors believe that allowing players to get the most suitable and favorite game functions and mechanisms through their own behaviors is a very conducive design for players to get a good game experience.
                            On the other hand, this is exactly what the background of this game wants to express and emphasize!
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>There is no road in this world, and only when more people walk on it, there is a road.

                        
                        </p>
                        <p>The author calls the moment of unlocking a functional module through accumulated behavior a "flash of insight". As in the beginning of the game, human beings came from the chaos, naked and ignorant. It was countless human ancestors who, through countless repeated attempts over the course of countless years, finally had a "flash of insight" at a certain moment, understood a certain principle, and gave meaning to a certain behavior. This moment may be Newton who was hit by an apple, Copernicus who looked up at the stars, or Aristotle who was taking a bath.
                        
                        </p>
                        <p>A single "flash of light" is like a spark that glows faintly in the infinite universe. 

                        </p>
                        <p>From the Paleolithic Age to the present, in millions of years, tens of billions of human beings spread over 149 trillion square meters of land, countless "flashes of light", countless "small sparks" lit up the whole world.The world created by players, by human beings, by all of us, is our world, and it is also "blazing epoch".

                        </p>
